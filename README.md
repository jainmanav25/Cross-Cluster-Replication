# Cross-Cluster Replication in Elasticsearch

## Problem:
The client requested assistance in setting up Cross-Cluster Replication (CCR) between two Elasticsearch clusters: one serving as the leader cluster and the other as the follower cluster. The client sought a detailed step-by-step guide to configure CCR in a Windows environment, including data synchronization and replication processes.

---

## Process:
Upon receiving the request, the expert gathered details about the clientâ€™s Elasticsearch setup, including:
- **Cluster information**: Version, single-node setup, and network configuration.
- **Licenses**: Ensuring both clusters support CCR (requires Platinum or Enterprise license).
- **Security**: Confirmation that the clusters will operate without security for simplicity.
- **Replication scope**: Identifying the indices requiring replication.

After gathering the details, the expert provided the client with a structured implementation plan and scheduled a follow-up meeting to address queries.

## Solution:
The expert designed a comprehensive plan to implement CCR as follows:

### 1. Pre-Configuration Preparations

#### A. Prerequisites:
1. Install Elasticsearch (7.16 or higher) on both leader and follower machines.
2. Ensure both clusters can communicate over the network.
3. Set up Java Runtime Environment (if not included in your Elasticsearch distribution).
4. Verify that both clusters have compatible configurations and licenses.

#### B. Take Snapshots:
1. On the leader cluster:
   - Create a backup of indices you wish to replicate:
   ```bash
   PUT _snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1

- Confirm the snapshot is successful.
2. On the follower cluster:
- Import the snapshot repository to ensure access to any critical pre-existing data.

### 2. Setup Leader and Follower Clusters:
#### A. Configure Elasticsearch YAML Files:
- On the Leader Cluster:
   ```bash
   cluster.name: leader-cluster
   node.name: leader-node
   network.host: 0.0.0.0
   http.port: 9200
   discovery.seed_hosts: []
   cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["leader-node"]
- On the Follower Cluster:
   ```bash
   cluster.name: follower-cluster
   node.name: follower-node
   network.host: 0.0.0.0
   http.port: 9200
   discovery.seed_hosts: []
   cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["follower-node"]
- Restart Elasticsearch services after modifying the configuration.
#### B. Connect Clusters:
Use the proxy mode for CCR to simplify the setup in Windows environments:
   ```bash
   PUT /_cluster/settings
   {
     "persistent": {
       "cluster.remote.leader-cluster.mode": "proxy",
       "cluster.remote.leader-cluster.proxy_address": "LEADER_CLUSTER_IP:9300",
       "cluster.remote.leader-cluster.skip_unavailable": true
     }
   }
```
### 3. Create Leader Index for Replication
On the leader cluster, create an index for replication:
   ```bash
   PUT /leader-index
   {
     "settings": {
       "index.number_of_shards": 1,
       "index.number_of_replicas": 0
     }
   }
```
Add data to the leader index:
   ```bash
   POST /leader-index/_doc
      {
        "field1": "value1",
        "field2": "value2"
      }
```
### 4. Set Up CCR on Follower Cluster
   #### A. Create a Follower Index:
